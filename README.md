# CurveFever Clone

This is a clone of [curvefever.io](http://curvefever.io/) that I wrote in the
2nd year of high school (2016) in Pascal (this is a
[Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) project). It's a two-player game
featuring all collectables.

Required libraries:

* SDL 1.2
* SDL\_gfx
* SDL\_ttf
* SDL\_image

Disclaimer: I don't own the game resources (both fonts and most of the images).
